# HiQNet
This project provides a HiQNet library for sending commands to HiQNet devices.

## What is HiQNet
HiQnet is a software protocol developed by Harman Professional Solutions, a division of Harman International Industries, which is used for controlling and monitoring audio and lighting systems. It allows for seamless integration and communication between different devices and systems, regardless of their manufacturer or model. HiQnet enables users to remotely control parameters such as volume, EQ, and other settings, as well as monitor system status and performance in real-time. It is widely used in professional audio and lighting applications, such as live events, concerts, and installations in performance venues, conference centers, and other public spaces.

## What is the purpose of this project
This project was initially created to communicate with a soundcraft si expression 1 mixer to send commadns. The plan is to develop this further so that it can be used as a library in a bitfocus companion module.
